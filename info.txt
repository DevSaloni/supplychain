Project Name: BlockTrace – Decentralized Supply Chain Tracker
🚚 Problem It Solves:
In traditional supply chains:

Anyone can fake product origin.

Buyers can’t trust if the item is original or tampered.

There's no transparency between manufacturer → buyer.

🎯 What You Will Build
🏗️ 1. Actors (Users):
Each will have a dashboard:

Actor	Role Description
Manufacturer	Adds product details to blockchain (origin)
Transporter	Updates product location/status
Retailer	Marks product received and sale-ready
Customer	Scans product QR code to check its history on blockchain

🧱 2. Technology Stack
Part	Tech Used
Frontend (UI)	React.js + Tailwind CSS
Backend API	Node.js + Express.js
Database	MongoDB (User roles, extra metadata)
Blockchain	Ethereum (Solidity Smart Contracts)
Integration	Web3.js or Ethers.js
Wallet	MetaMask
File Storage	Optional: IPFS (for product images or documents)
QR Code	npm QR generator + Scanner

🔐 3. Smart Contract Details
Smart Contract Name: SupplyChain.sol

🔗 What it stores:
Product ID (hash or unique string)

Product name & manufacturer name

Status updates: manufacturing → transport → retail

Timestamps

Wallet address of the one who made the update

📲 4. Frontend Pages (React Components)
🔵 Common
✅ Login/Register page (connect MetaMask + store user role)

✅ Dashboard (based on user role)

🔴 Manufacturer Dashboard
Form to enter:

Product name

Batch number

Description

Upload image (optional → IPFS)

Button: “Add to Blockchain”

🔵 Transporter Dashboard
See product list (from MongoDB)

Click product → update status: “In Transit”, “Arrived at Retailer”

🟢 Retailer Dashboard
See incoming products

Click to mark “Received & For Sale”

🟣 Customer Page
Scan QR code

View product history (all steps, with timestamps)

{
  name: "Saloni",
  email: "saloni@abc.com",
  role: "manufacturer", // or transporter, retailer, customer
  walletAddress: "0xabc123..."
}
🔹 Products (optional, off-chain metadata)
js
Copy
Edit
{
  productId: "PRD123XYZ",
  productName: "Golden Chair",
  manufacturer: "0xabc123...",
  imageHash: "Qm...abc", // optional from IPFS
}
🧠 Smart Contract Sample Structure (Solidity)
solidity
Copy
Edit
struct Product {
    string name;
    address manufacturer;
    string status;
    address[] history;
    string[] statusUpdates;
    uint[] timestamps;
}
mapping(string => Product) public products;
🔎 Example Use Case
Imagine a customer buys a piece of furniture on Meesho. She scans the QR code and sees:

✅ Manufacturer: “WoodArt Co.” – 2 Aug 2025

✅ Transported by: “GoSafe Logistics” – 3 Aug 2025

✅ Retailer received: “Fancy Furniture” – 5 Aug 2025

This builds trust and shows blockchain skills + full-stack power 💥

💻 Your Next Steps (As You Said: Start from UI First)
✅ Design login/register UI (use Tailwind + React)

✅ Build dashboard layouts for each role

🔜 Connect MetaMask wallet

🔜 Integrate smart contract interaction (write + read)

🔜 Add backend to store extra info (MongoDB)

🔜 Optional: add IPFS & QR code scanner

✅ 1. Navbar (Top Navigation Bar) — Clean & Informative
Include these tabs:

Logo/Brand Name: DecentraChain or SupplySync

Home

Track Product

Add Product / Manufacturer

Verify Product

About

Connect Wallet (button)

If you're using Metamask + ethers.js, connect wallet here and show the address.

✅ 2. Hero Section (Top Banner)
A strong message:

"Revolutionizing Supply Chains with Blockchain"
Track, verify, and manage goods across the globe securely and transparently.

🖼️ Add an illustration: chain, globe, logistics truck, or blockchain nodes.

CTA Buttons:

Track Product

Add New Product

✅ 3. Features Section (Cards or Grid)
Showcase benefits of your platform:

🚀 Feature	💬 Description
🔒 Transparency	Every transaction is logged on blockchain.
📦 Real-Time Tracking	View the current status of a product in the supply chain.
✅ Product Verification	Users can verify if a product is genuine.
🌍 Decentralized System	No central authority — tamper-proof supply chain.

✅ 4. Workflow Section
Show how your system works in 3–4 steps:

🏭 Manufacturer adds product details.

🚚 Transporter updates location info.

🛍️ Seller updates sale status.

🧾 Customer verifies authenticity.

Use icons + brief text for each step.

✅ 5. Live Tracker Section
Add a mini form with:

Enter Product ID: [_________]

🔍 Track button

Show real-time product location/status if ID is valid.

✅ 6. Footer
Include:

Quick links (Home, About, GitHub)

Contact info (email or wallet address)

Built using: React, Ethers.js, Tailwind CSS, Solidity

🧠 Optional Additions (for advanced UI):
📈 Stats: Show total products added, verified, manufacturers onboarded.

🌐 World Map: Pins showing product origins and destinations

What You Can Add To Impress Further
Detailed Analytics Dashboard
Show statistics like number of products tracked, average delivery times, or fraud attempts detected — companies love data-driven insights.

Real-Time Notifications
Push alerts or emails to stakeholders when status changes — shows you handle event-driven features.

IPFS Integration for Product Files
Store product images/docs decentralized (not just hash) — adds more depth to blockchain knowledge.

Smart Contract Security Features
Demonstrate contract upgradeability, access control (only roles can update their parts), or handle disputes.

Mobile Friendly & Responsive Design
Show you care about UX across devices.

Testing & Deployment
Include unit tests for contracts and backend, and deploy on testnet or mainnet — adds professionalism.

Documentation & Demo Video
Write clear README and record a short demo walkthrough — recruiters love this.
