## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The Decentralized Supply Chain Tracker allows:

- Manufacturers to add products and register roles.
- Transporters to update the status during transit.
- Retailers to confirm receipt of products.
- Verification of products by all participants to ensure authenticity.

The platform integrates **React.js frontend, Node.js backend, MongoDB**, and **Solidity smart contracts** for blockchain tracking.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `frontend/` : React.js web application (UI for manufacturer, transporter, retailer)
- `backend/`  : Node.js + Express API (handles requests from frontend)
- `blockchain/` : Solidity smart contracts for supply chain management

---

## ðŸ›  Features

- Add new product with manufacturer, transporter, and retailer roles.
- Update product status at every stage: Manufactured â†’ In Transit â†’ Received for Sale.
- Track product history and verify roles for authenticity.
- Summary dashboards for Manufacturer, Transporter, and Retailer.
- Full decentralized verification using blockchain.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST API
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, Hardhat, Truffle, Ethereum, MetaMask
- **Other Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, React Icons, React Toastify

## âš¡ Smart Contract Details

The `SupplyChain.sol` contract includes:

- **Enums & Structs:** Stage, StatusUpdate, RoleAddresses, Product
- **Mappings:** products, productHistory, productVerifiedRoles, approvals
- **Events:** ProductAdded, StatusUpdated, ProductVerified
- **Functions:**
  - `registerAsManufacturer() / registerAsTransporter() / registerAsRetailer()`
  - `addProduct()` â€“ Add a new product
  - `updateStatus()` â€“ Update product during transit
  - `markReceived()` â€“ Retailer confirms receipt
  - `verifyProduct()` â€“ Role verification
  - `getProductHistory()` â€“ Fetch history of product
  - `getVerifiedRoles()` â€“ Fetch addresses that verified
  - `getProductCount()` â€“ Total products
